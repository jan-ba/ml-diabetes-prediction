# Diabetes Prediction Project

This project focuses on predicting diabetes using machine learning models. It was developed as part of a university project by Alexander Svarfdal Gu√∞mundsson and Jan Babin.

## Project Overview

- **Goal:** Build and evaluate machine learning models to predict diabetes based on health-related features.
- **Tools Used:** Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, PyCaret, Matplotlib, Seaborn.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Scaling, encoding, and correlation analysis.
- **Model Training:** Comparison of multiple classification algorithms using PyCaret.
- **Ensembling:** Implemented stacking and blending for improved accuracy.

## Dataset

The dataset, "Diabetes, Hypertension and Stroke Prediction," was sourced from Kaggle. It includes demographic and lifestyle indicators.
